# odin-Etch-a-Sketch ðŸŽ¨

This project is a simple web-based version of the classic Etch-a-Sketch drawing toy. Users can draw by hovering over a grid of squares, with each interaction gradually changing the square's background color and opacity. After 10 interactions or a click, the square resets to white.

## Features
- Dynamic grid creation with customizable size (up to 100x100)
- Random color generation for drawing
- Opacity-based fading effect
- Reset squares by clicking
- Responsive layout with styled header and instructions

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** for dynamic DOM manipulation and interactivity

## What I Learned
- Creating and modifying DOM elements with JavaScript
- Handling user interactions and events
- Implementing logic for state tracking (e.g., interaction count per square)
- Styling with Flexbox for responsive design
